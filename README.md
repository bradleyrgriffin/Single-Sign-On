# Single Sign On
In this project, I created a demonstration of how to implement Single Sign On Services for a windows based system.

I created two cloud-based apps, that were built on the ASP.NET MVC framework, that utilized WS-Federated Authentication, which contacted my Azure active Directory and would sign you on to both apps, so long as you signed into one, and order did not matter.

Utilizing the free Dreamspark account I have access to as a student of Thomas College, I created and hosted two servers that contained my web apps, and also created a third server with my active directory; just to ensure that every component was operating independently.

After creation of these servers and web apps, I added authentication and created a demonstration of SSO. This SSO project has real-world applications, because many businesses would like to have SSO enabled for their system, rather than utilizing different usernames and passwords for every piece of software.

These are links to the two apps:

There is not much content or graphical design put into the project, because the beauty is behind the scenes with the SSO service.

Dummy username: dummy@bradraymondgriffingmail.onmicrosoft.com
Dummy password: "Ia20yo.MniB."

Feel free to check out my project's ability to sign you in simultaneously to both of the applications.
